This is an unfinished Marvel App for iOS with Firebase so users can register/login, seek and view the details of their favourite Marvel characters. 
This app is being deployed still. It has issues in Event and Character View Controller related to the tableView, but I can't fix it at the moment. It would be awesome if you have an idea of how to approach this!
